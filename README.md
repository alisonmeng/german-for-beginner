## üñåÔ∏è Design Notes
- **Color scheme:** adapted from [Visme color palettes](https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/).  
- **Typography:** monospace for a casual learning tone; font size uses `clamp()` for responsiveness.  
- **Accessibility:** `scroll-margin-top` prevents navbar overlap on anchor jumps.  
- **Floating back-to-top:** pure CSS anchor (`href="#top"`) with smooth scroll.
